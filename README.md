## Using project

### On live environment

The final app hosted on <a alt="Logo Scene screenshot" target="_blank" href="https://js-face-detection.firebaseapp.com">https://js-face-detection.firebaseapp.com/</a>

### On local environment

Run these commands in the terminal to run the app on your local environment

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/js-face-detection.git

    npm install

    npm start

or if you use yarn as package manager

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/js-face-detection.git

    yarn

    yarn start

### Development server

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` for a dev server to initialize. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## App's Motivation
* I've created this project to use the AI-powered Face Detection API in an application. By that, I've achieved an application that detects your face simultaneously and shows your emotions.
